# Revelation Chapter 1 (NIV)
1 The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, 2 who testifies to everything he sawâ€”that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. 3 Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near...

18 "To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze. 19 I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first. 20 Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols. 21 I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling." [1]

# Revelation Chapter 21 (NJB)
1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; the first heaven and the first earth had disappeared now, and there was no longer any sea. 2 I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride dressed for her husband... 5 Then the One sitting on the throne spoke: 'Look, I am making the whole of creation new. Write this: that these words are already trustworthy and established.' 6 Then he said, 'It is already done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End...'" [2]

# Revelation Chapter 22 (NJB)
1 Then the angel showed me the river of life, rising from the throne of God and of the Lamb and flowing crystal-clear... 3 The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city; his servants will worship him, 4 they will see him face to face, and his name will be written on their foreheads... 12 'Look, I am coming soon, and my reward is with me, to repay everyone as their deeds deserve. 13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.'" [2]
